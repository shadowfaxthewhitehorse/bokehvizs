This folder has the F series (Bokeh plots).

The Python code generates JPG images (as seen in the folder), and these images show Candlestick Plots for various stocks on U.S. stock exchanges (NASDAQ, et cetera).

More plots are available in the parent directory. Look for images with the prefix "F__".

For original source code, or answers to questions, please contact me directly.
